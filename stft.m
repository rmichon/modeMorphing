function X = stft(x, nbins, nskip)
% STFT - short-time Fourier rransform
%
% X = stft(x, nbins, nskip) returns X, the short-time Fourier transform of the
% input column x, computed using nbins-long signal segments, and a 2*nbins DFT
% with a hop size of nskip samples.  A Hanning window is used by default;
% however if nbins has more than one element, it is used as the window, and the
% DFT size is the length of nbins(:).  The hop size nskip is half the DFT size
% by default.  Note that the DFT size is quantized to a power of 2 using
% nextpow2().
%
% If x has multiple columns, then the STFT is computed for each of the columns,
% and the result is the concatenation of the column spectrograms, nbins+1 tall,
%
